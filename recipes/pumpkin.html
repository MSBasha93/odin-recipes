    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In case you weren't aware, a pumpkin's flavor goes far beyond pie and pumpkin bread. It's a great way to add some
        depth and heartiness to pasta, and this ultra-creamy pasta bake blends sweet pumpkin with savory sausage, bacon,
        and Parmesan cheese to make a delicious dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound rotini pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crumbled cooked bacon</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the
            bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain
            sausage on paper towels and reserve 2 tablespoons grease in the skillet. Add oil to grease in the skillet;
            cook and stir onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot oil-grease until onion is soft, about 3
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken broth, pumpkin, bacon, Italian seasoning, and salt into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Lower
            heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir cream and sausage into broth mixture and simmer until creamy and
            thickened, about 5 minutes. Add rotini and gently toss. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and top
            with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown, about 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
