    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"This chicken pot pie pasta bake is very moist, rich, and flavorful, with buttery bread crumbs serving as a
        brilliant stand-in for pie crust. This is the perfect comfort food—a pasta casserole—that tastes just like that
        other perfect comfort food—chicken pot pie." </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole roasted chicken</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 carrots, cubed</li>
        <li>3 ribs celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon chicken bouillon paste</li>
        <li>1 cup green peas</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 pound dry pasta shells</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pull meat from chicken and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Add 2 quarts of water to a pot and transfer in chicken bones, skin, and any meat scraps. Add bay leaf and
            bring to a simmer on high heat. Reduce to low and simmer for 2 hours. Remove to cool, about 1 hour. Strain
            broth and reserve in refrigerator until needed. This may make more broth than the 6 cups needed.</li>
        <li>To make the pot pie mixture, add butter to a pot and melt over medium-high heat. Add onions, carrots,
            celery, and salt. Cook, stirring, until onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Season with pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and cayenne, and cook for 1 minute more. Add flour and cook until
            flour toasts to a golden brown on the bottom of the pot, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in 6 cups of broth, and bring to a simmer on high heat, then reduce to medium. Add peas and cream and
            cook, stirring, for 10 minutes. Cut chicken meat into small bite-size pieces and add it in. Cook 5 minutes
            more. Turn off heat and reserve.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil.
            Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, i minute less than specified in package directions.. Drain very
            well; stir pasta into pot pie mixture. Transfer everything into a large, deep baking dish (about 4 1/2 quart
            size), and distribute evenly.</li>
        <li>Stir panko, salt, and melted butter together in a bowl; sprinkle evenly over casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling around the edges and top is browned, 45 to 60
            minutes. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
