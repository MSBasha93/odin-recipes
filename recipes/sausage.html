    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"So my husband literally inhaled his first plate (are you hungry honey or did you like it?), inhaled his second
        plate (I had barely gotten halfway through my first), and even though he said he was full, went in for a third
        helping," community member Firefly9 says. "I made the recipe as stated and will definitely be making it again.
        Even my picky 9-year-old asked when I would be making it again before he was even done eating. Yep, it's a
        keeper."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>

        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>

        <li>1 pound baby portobello mushrooms, sliced</li>

        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>

        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded whole milk mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; cook the penne uncovered, stirring occasionally, until
            tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the
            sausage in the hot oil until crumbly and no longer pink, about 7 minutes: remove from the skillet, leaving
            the fat in the pan, and set aside. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into the skillet and add
            the mushrooms and garlic. Cook and stir until the mushrooms have browned and begun to release their liquid,
            about 5 minutes more. Return the sausage to the skillet and pour in the heavy cream. Season with salt and
            pepper and return to a simmer, cooking until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes more. Pour the
            sauce over the pasta and stir. Stir in 1/2 cup mozzarella and Parmesan. Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish
            and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.</li>

        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese is bubbly and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
